- Fetches fund prices from Morningstar
- Fetches stock prices from yfinance
- Updates history in Google Apps Script

**Query Parameters:**
- `year` (required): Year (e.g., 2024)
- `month` (required): Month (1-12)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully fetched X prices",
  "year": 2024,
  "month": 2,
  "lastBusinessDay": "2024-02-29",
  "prices": [
    {
      "assetId": "btc-usd",
      "assetName": "Bitcoin",
      "ticker": "BTC-EUR",
      "price": 42500.50,
      "currency": "EUR",
      "fetchedAt": "2024-02-26T18:30:00Z",
      "source": "yfinance"
    }
  ],
  "errors": []
}
```

### Get Assets

```
GET /assets
```

Get list of all assets from Google Apps Script.

### Update Prices

```
POST /update-prices
Content-Type: application/json

[{
  "assetId": "asset-1",
  "assetName": "Asset Name",
  "price": 1000.50,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "fetchedAt": "2024-02-26T18:30:00Z",
  "source": "manual"
}]
```

Update price data manually and persist to Google Apps Script.

## Asset Configuration

Assets need to be configured with proper identifiers:

### Bitcoin/Crypto
- `ticker`: "BTC-EUR" (for Bitcoin)
- Category: "Crypto"

### Mutual Funds
- `isin`: ISIN code (e.g., "ES0165151004")
- Category: "Fund"

### Stocks
- `ticker`: Stock ticker (e.g., "AAPL")
- Category: "Stock" or "Stocks"

### Pension Plans
- `ticker` or `isin`: Identifier for the plan
- Category: "Pension Plan"

## Data Persistence

Prices are automatically persisted to Google Apps Script in the `history` array with format:

```json
{
  "month": "2024-02",
  "assetId": "asset-id",
  "nav": 42500.50,
  "contribution": 42500.50,
  "source": "yfinance",
  "date": "2024-02-26T18:30:00Z"
}
```

## Data Sources

- **Bitcoin & Stocks**: yfinance (Yahoo Finance)
- **Mutual Funds**: Morningstar (via ISIN), with fallback to Financial Times Markets

## Last Business Day Calculation

The API automatically calculates the last business day of any given month:
- Avoids weekends (Saturday/Sunday)
- Fetches prices as of this date
- Prevents fetching prices on weekends when markets are closed

## CORS Configuration

The API is configured to accept requests from `http://localhost:3000` by default. To change this, update `FRONTEND_URL` in `.env`.

## Error Handling

The API provides detailed error information:
- Missing assets: Listed in the `errors` array
- Failed fetches: Individual error messages per asset
- Will return partial results if some assets fail

## Development

### Adding New Asset Sources

1. Create a new service in `services/` directory
2. Implement price fetching logic
3. Add to `main.py` in the `fetch_month_prices` function
4. Test with sample assets

### Testing

Sample assets are provided when GAS URL is not configured or unavailable.

## Troubleshooting

### "GAS URL not configured"
- Check that `GAS_URL` is set in `.env`
- Verify the Google Apps Script deployment ID

### "Failed to fetch Bitcoin price"
- Check internet connection
- Verify yfinance is not rate-limited
- Try again later

### "Failed to fetch fund price"
- Verify ISIN code is correct
- Check if fund exists on Morningstar
- Try the Financial Times fallback

## Security

- CORS is configured for frontend URL only
- NO authentication implemented (suitable for personal use)
- Add authentication if exposing to internet
